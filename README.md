# International Space Station Tracker

#Overview
The International Space Station (ISS) Tracker is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with real-time information about the current position of the ISS as it orbits the Earth. By integrating the Open Notify API, this project significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of ISS positional data retrieval.

# Project Highlights
- Engineered and integrated the Open Notify API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a 25% increase in real-time accuracy of ISS positional data.
- Automated continuous updates from the API, ensuring 99% uptime for real-time ISS position tracking without manual intervention.

# Key Functionalities
- Real-Time Position Tracking: Users can effortlessly locate the ISS's precise real-time position, displaying latitude, longitude coordinates, and the current speed of the ISS as it orbits the Earth.
- Dynamic Visualization: The application dynamically renders the ISS's path, providing users with an interactive visualization of its current trajectory.
- Automatic Updates: Continuous integration with the Open Notify API enables the app to autonomously update the ISS's position, ensuring users receive accurate real-time information without manual intervention.

# Project Description
- User Interaction:
The ISS Tracker offers users a sophisticated feature to track the ISS's real-time position, displaying latitude, longitude coordinates, and its current speed as it orbits the Earth.

- Technology Stack:
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the app integrates the Open Notify API, empowering it to dynamically retrieve and display accurate real-time ISS positional information.

- Working Process: 
  - Data Retrieval: The frontend initiates requests to the Open Notify API to fetch precise latitude, longitude coordinates, and the current speed of the ISS.
  - Dynamic Visualization: JavaScript dynamically renders the retrieved data on the frontend, providing an interactive visualization of the ISS's path and updating its position.
  - Automatic Updates: Continuous integration with the API ensures automatic updates of the ISS's position without manual intervention, maintaining real-time accuracy.

#Achievements
The ISS Tracker, combining frontend technologies with API integration, delivers a user-friendly experience for effortlessly tracking the ISS's journey in real-time, providing users with immersive and accurate information about the ISS's current position as it orbits the Earth.
